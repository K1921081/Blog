            <b><i>Prison Escape</i></b> is a 3D first-person narrative design game developed by me (Alex Tsvetanov),
            Ibby Hussain, Luke Webster and Malaika Fahed, that implements a complete game based on a given narrative.
        </p>
        <h3>Plot</h3>
        <p>
            Prison Escape features Sam Rhodes, a young banker who gets a phone call from an unknown number that tells
            him to go visit his brother, Gerald Rhodes, in his apartment. Upon arrival, he searches the place to
            find his brother dead. In the meantime, he hears sirens as the police have arrived on the scene, and are
            attempting to arrest him. He tries to escape, but gets caught when exiting the apartment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sam gets convicted of murdering his brother, and gets sent to prison. Looking to avenge him and seek vengeance
            on whoever framed him, he looks for a way to get justice. When he arrives in his prison cell and studies the
            conditions he is in, he soon realises that his prison is underfunded, run down and with low security, which
            gives him the idea that he should try to escape.
        </p>
        <p>
            He then proceeds to look for any weaknesses in the system that he could exploit, and takes advantage of them.
            He eventually manages to sneak out of his cell, and attempt to make an escape from prison. On his way out, he
            decides to look for some clues as to why he was framed and unfairly imprisoned. After checking the offices around
            the building, he discovers some documents left by the warden, which admit that the entire thing was a plan by
            a corrupt officer targeted at Sam. He then develops the perfect idea for his justice: get out of prison with
            these documents, and publish them online to prove his innocence and get the corrupt officer convicted.
        </p>
        <p>
            After sneaking out of his prison complex, barely avoiding getting caught by the guards, he proceeds towards a
            nearby cafe, where he finds and uses one of the computers there to publish the documents online. He is eventually
            cleared of all charges, the officer gets convicted, and justice gets served.
        </p>
        <h3>Gameplay</h3>
        <p>
            The player is controlled using the mouse and keyboard. WASD is used to move the player, and the mouse determines
            the direction in which to move. The mouse can also be used to look around. Some game events, such as opening doors,
            happened when pressing the E key.
        </p>
        <p>
            The game is played out in a 3D world where the player character gets spawned a certain location in every level and
            the goal of the game is to make it to the end. The end of the level is at a certain object, which is different for
            every level according to its objective. During gameplay, the currrent level's objective is displayed at the top
            left of the screen.
        </p>
        <h3>Techical Design</h3>
        <p>
            Prison Escape is developed using the Unity game engine and C#. It uses Unity UI and TextMeshPro for implementing the
            game UI, a PlayerController component with custom movement code to move the player around the game world, and colliders
            and triggers to implement level collision and game rules.
