        <p class="aboutme">
            I'm a 23 year old game developer who currently studies computer games programming at Kingston University London.
            This blog website is dedicated to showcasing the work I've accomplished throughout my course.
        </p>
        <p class="aboutme">
            I've been programming since around the age of 13 and I have used many different technologies to create games:
            HTML5 Canvas with JavaScript, C++ with SDL2, C# with Unity, C++ with Unreal Engine, OpenGL and Vulkan. The games I have created
            range from 2D platformers to 3D first person shooter survival games.
        </p>
        <p class="aboutme">
            Outside of game development, I also have an interest in other software fields - programmer tooling, business software, web
            development, system programming, cybersecurity and more. My favourite language is C++, but I can also use C, and have some knownledge of
            JavaScript, C#, and Rust. I can also do shader programming with GLSL.
