            <b><i>Lost In The Woods</i></b> is a 2D shooter survival game where the player is stranded
            in the woods in the middle of a zombie apocalypse and has to find his way to safety.
        </p>
        <h3>Plot</h3>
        <p>
            The plot of the story is about a meteorological station worker fulfilling his duties as a part of
            an ordinary day when he gets a report about a contagious dicease spreading rapidly and turning its
            victims into ravenous, homicidal zombies.
        </p>
        <p>
            After hearing the horrifying news, he is stuck there wondering what he should do next. He tries calling
            his coworkers for help, but gets no response. The radio mentions something about a safe house setup in the city.
            With nowhere else to go, he decides that his only hope for survival is to make his way there.
        </p>
        <p>
            He makes his way through a series of obstacles, from the woods, all the way to the city, in order to escape to safety.
            Along the way, he encounters large hordes of zombies that stand in his way. Armed with a gun, he kills every
            undead that stands between him and his sanctuary.
        </p>
        <h3>Gameplay</h3>
        <p>
            The game is played using both mouse and keyboard. The WASD keys on the keyboard can move the player around the map,
            and the mouse is used to aim, with left-clicking firing projectiles. The game features 3 levels of varying difficulty,
            with every next level having more zombies and a more difficult to navigate map.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each level has a number of zombies that the player has to get past. Each zombie has a certain amount of health
            as well as its own game state that determines its behaviour. By default, a zombie is in the idle state, which
            causes it to stay still in one spot. When the player gets too close, it enters the chase state, which makes it
            follow the player in a straight line until it gets close enough to attack. When it gets close enough, it enters
            the attack state, making it attack the player at a certain interval, causing him to lose 5 health every time.
            When the player's health drops to 0, the level ends and the game over screen is opened, which prompts the player
            to go back to the main menu or retry the current level. The player can also shoot projectiles at the zombies,
            with each projectile hitting causing them to lose 1hp. When a zombie's health drops to 0, it dies, playing a
            death sound (if sound is not muted) and making it disappear from the map.
        </p>
        <p>
            The goal of each level is to get to the circle with a dot in the middle indicating the level end. This causes the
            game to progress to the next level, and to the game won screen if the level is the final one.
        </p>
        <h3>Technical Design</h3>
        <p>
            Lost In The Woods is created using a custom game engine that uses APIs such as Vulkan for rendering graphics,
            SDL2 for windowing and event handling, SDL2_mixer for playing audio, glm for mathematics, stbi_image for loading
            images and FreeType for loading glyphs and rendering text.
        </p>
        <p>
            The engine supports many elements that are often used in video games, such as rendering, audio, event handling,
            graphical user interfaces (GUIs), collision testing and artifical intelligence. It is tailored specifically
            for the game being developed, using only the systems that are necessary for the game, and with a structure that
            best suits its needs. All of the game's source code is written in C++.
